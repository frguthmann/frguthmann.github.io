      <description>Welcome to Bits &amp;amp; Pixies! What is this? Well this blog is my attempt at sharing some of the knowledge I&amp;rsquo;ve gained thanks to the work of so many talented and amazing people in the graphics community.
Not everything in here will be up to date and / or to be taken as ground truth. This is me trying to figure out graphics and sharing the results of my experimentations.</description>
