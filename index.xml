      <description> &amp;ldquo;Hello, friend?&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s lame. Maybe I should give you a name&amp;hellip; But that&amp;rsquo;s a slippery slope. You&amp;rsquo;re only in my head. We have to remember that&amp;hellip; Shit. It&amp;rsquo;s actually happened. I&amp;rsquo;m talking to an imaginary person.

      <description>This is my own implementation of Ray Tracing in a weekend by Peter Shirley. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple and follows directly the book but the result is always satisfying to watch. Unfortunately, I was finishing the equivalent of my Master&amp;rsquo;s Thesis at the time and didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to implementing the other books.

The the two main modifications I made were using stb_image.</description>

      <description>In 2017 I started studying computer graphics at school. We were given a lot of boiler plate code during practical exercises. Sometimes it felt like everything was working through some kind of dark magic. It was especially frustrating when something wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work. There were too many unknowns.
So during the summer holiday I gave myself the goal to write my own prototype from scratch. I decided to use WebGL because I knew a little JavaScript and figured it had the fastest iteration cycle.</description>
