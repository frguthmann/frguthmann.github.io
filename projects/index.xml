      <description>In 2017 I started studying computer graphics at school. We were given a lot of boiler plate code during practical exercises. Sometimes it felt like everything was working through some kind of dark magic. It was especially frustrating when something wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work because there were too many unknowns.
So during the summer holiday I gave myself the goal to write my own prototype from scratch. I decided to use WebGL because I knew a little JavaScript and figured it had the fastest iteration cycle.</description>
